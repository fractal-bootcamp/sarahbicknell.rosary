      "SoCC": `In the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. 
      I believe in one God,
      the Father almighty,
      maker of heaven and earth,
      of all things visible and invisible.
      
      I believe in one Lord Jesus Christ,
      the Only Begotten Son of God,
      born of the Father before all ages.
      God from God, Light from Light,
      true God from true God,
      begotten, not made, consubstantial with the Father;
      through him all things were made.
      For us men and for our salvation
      he came down from heaven,
      and by the Holy Spirit was incarnate of the Virgin Mary,
      and became man.
      For our sake he was crucified under Pontius Pilate,
      he suffered death and was buried,
      and rose again on the third day
      in accordance with the Scriptures.
      He ascended into heaven
      and is seated at the right hand of the Father.
      He will come again in glory
      to judge the living and the dead
      and his kingdom will have no end.
      
      I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Lord, the giver of life,
      who proceeds from the Father and the Son,
      who with the Father and the Son is adored and glorified,
      who has spoken through the prophets.
      
      I believe in one, holy, catholic and apostolic Church.
      I confess one Baptism for the forgiveness of sins
      and I look forward to the resurrection of the dead
      and the life of the world to come. Amen.`,
    
    
     "Our Father": "Our Father, Who art in heaven, hallowed be Thy name; Thy kingdom come; Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread; and forgive us our trespasses as we forgive those who trespass against us; and lead us not into temptation, but deliver us from evil. Amen."
    ,
    
       "Hail Mary": "Hail Mary, Full of Grace, The Lord is with thee. Blessed art thou among women, and blessed is the fruit of thy womb, Jesus. Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us sinners now, and at the hour of death. Amen."

     "Hail Holy Queen": `Hail, holy Queen, mother of mercy, our life, our sweetness, and our hope. To thee do we cry, poor banished children of Eve. To thee do we send up our sighs mourning and weeping in this valley of tears. Turn then, most gracious advocate, thine eyes of mercy toward us, and after this our exile show us the blessed fruit of thy womb, Jesus. O clement, O loving, O sweet Virgin Mary.
      Pray for us, O Holy Mother of God.
      
      That we may be made worthy of the promises of Christ.
      
      In the Name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen.`
